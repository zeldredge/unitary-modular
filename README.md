This code is intended to reproduce the results in "Unitary Entanglement Generation in Hierarchical Quantum Networks", Bapat et al 2018. We include code and notebooks which allow for the simulation of GHZ state creation on arbitrary graphs as well as performing circuit placement on hierarchical products.

Required Python packages:
- NumPy
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

Additionally, we use the Metis graph partitioning package as a subroutine in the circuit placement code. Therefore, to run this code, you must also install Metis from the following link: http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/download

This code should run on Mac and Linux systems.
